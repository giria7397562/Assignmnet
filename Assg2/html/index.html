        <h2>[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]</h2>
        <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</p>
        <p>Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface</p>
        <p>I don't know what you're expecting of me</p>
        <p>Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes</p>

        <p class="highlight">
          Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
        </p>
        <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</p>

        <p class="chorus">I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</p>
        <p class="chorus">Become so tired, so much more aware</p>
        <p class="chorus">I'm becoming this, all I want to do</p>
        <p class="chorus">Is be more like me and be less like you</p>

        <h2>[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]</h2>
        <p>Can't you see that you're smothering me?</p>
        <p>Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control</p>
        <p>'Cause everything that you thought I would be</p>
        <p>Has fallen apart, right in front of you</p>

          Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
        </p>
        <p>And every second I waste is more than I can take</p>

        <p>You were just like me with someone disappointed in you</p>
